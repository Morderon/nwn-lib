=== migrate_03x_to_04x.sh

This can be used to migrate old YAML dumps made with version 0.3.x to the new,
compacter format of 0.4.x.

Usage is simple: just pass all old .yml files to the script, it will convert them
in-place.

This uses nwn-gff-convert, so all environment variables are taken into consideration.
You will want to point NWN_LIB_INFER_DATA_FILE to something useful.

Backup and testing is ADVISED!
