== nwn-gff

A generic converter that can be used for converting gff files to and fro from various
file formats and presentations, and transform them with custom script filters.

Type
  nwn-gff -h
for help, it should be self-explanatory.

There are some usage examples on the CHEATSHEET.

== nwn-erf

nwn-erf can pack/unpack all mod, hak, erf and nwm files.

Type
  nwn-erf -h
for help.

== nwn-irb

nwn-irb is a interactive shell preloading all relevant libs, and optionally
loading a gff file.

There are some usage examples on the CHEATSHEET.

== nwn-dsl

A standalone script interpreter. See the example scripts in the gem distribution
under scripts/.

== Things under tools/

These are not added to PATH, you'll have to specify their path explicitly; you can
find them in your gem repository (/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/gems/ or similar).

=== migrate_03x_to_04x.sh

This can be used to migrate old YAML dumps made with version 0.3.x to the new,
compacter format of 0.4.x.

Usage is simple: just pass all old .yml files to the script, it will convert them
in-place (read: make a backup!).

This uses nwn-gff-convert and nwn-gff, so all environment variables are taken into
consideration. You will want to point NWN_LIB_INFER_DATA_FILE to something useful.

Backup and testing is ADVISED!
