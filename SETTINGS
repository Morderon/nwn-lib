There are various environment variables you can configure to adjust various parts of nwn-lib.

Under linux, just add them to your shell environment (usually .bashrc), like so:

  export NWN_LIB_INFER_DATA_FILE==/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/nwn-lib-0.4.0/data/gff-common-nwn1.yaml


== NWN_LIB_INFER_DATA_FILE

The path to the type/value inferring data file. See TYPE_VALUE_INFERRING for a definition.


== NWN_LIB_DONT_COMPACT_FIELDS

Set to non-nil ("1" will do) to prevent nwn-lib from compacting scalar fields into a more-readable
(but still fully parseable) format, if type inferring data is available.

=== Without compacting
  ItemList:
    value:
    - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct
      __data_type: UTC/ItemList
      __struct_id: 0
      InventoryRes: {value: herb053}
  PaletteID: {value: 6}
  SkillList: [{value: 0}, {value: 0}, {value: 0}, {value: 0}, ...

=== With compacting
  ItemList:
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct
    __data_type: UTC/ItemList
    InventoryRes: herb053
  PaletteID: 6
  SkillList: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 ...


== NWN_LIB_DONT_COMPACT_LIST_STRUCTS

Setting this to non-nil ("1" will do) will prevent nwn-lib from compacting lists that contain
structs, if type inferring data is available.

=== Without compacting
  SkillList:
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 2}
  - !nwn-lib.elv.es,2008-12/struct {__data_type: UTC/SkillList, Rank: 0}
  ...

=== With compacting
  SkillList: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...


== NWN_LIB_KEEP_KNOWN_VALUES

Set to non-nil ("1" will do) to prevent nwn-lib from omitting fields that resolve to default values
as configured in $NWN_LIB_INFER_DATA_FILE.

nwn-lib, by default, filters fields out of (some) dump formats that would resolve to values that
the NWN engine would fill with default values anyways.
