There are various environment variables you can configure to adjust various parts of nwn-lib.

<b>All of them are optional!</b>

Under linux, just add them to your shell environment (usually .bashrc), like so:

  export NWN_LIB_FILTER_EMPTY_EXOLOCSTR=1

== NWN_LIB_FILTER_EMPTY_EXOLOCSTR

Set to non-nil ("1" will do) to make nwn-lib filter out empty exolocstr fields from
input files on reading.

The default is to keep them as-is.

== NWN_LIB_2DA_LOCATION

Set to a path containing all 2da files to initialize the 2da cache. This is needed for
most interactive helpers and a few gizmos, and, of course, for TwoDA::Cache.

== NWN_LIB_TWODA_NEWLINE

Specify the type of newline that Table#to_2da uses to join rows.
 0 for windows newlines: \r\n (default)
 1 for unix newlines: \n
 2 for caret return only: \r
