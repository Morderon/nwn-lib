To help you manage your NWN data more efficiently, nwn-lib supports
user-written, small (or large) scripts that follow the unix principle
of piping.

=== Filter Scripts

Filter Scripts act as an argument to nwn-gff, and will be invoked
as a pass-through for data filtering and transformation.
Filters always depend on self being a Gff element.

An example of a filter script would be a snippet, that truncates
all floating points to a fixed size before outputting them to yaml.

Filter scripts are usually not executable by themself.

=== Standalone Scripts

Standalone scripts are shell scripts invokable from command line,
and do not operate on specific files; instead, they get invoked
with their own (optional) parameters and act independently of
data sources.

An example for a standalone script would be a script, that asks
the user for a name and then generates a random item from that.

=== API

There are various helpers available to scripts. See NWN::Gff::Scripting
for a list of helper methods; additionally you can use all other API
functions, of course.

There are some examples packaged together with nwn-lib, check the scripts/
directory with the distribution.
