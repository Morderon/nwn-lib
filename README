== A library for Neverwinter Nights 1/2 resource files

This package provides a library for reading, changing, and writing common file formats that are found with NWN[http://nwn.bioware.com/], a Bioware game.

They should work with NWN2 just as well, since the file format specifications did not change.

=== A word on version numbers

With the release of 0.4.0, the API changed significantly. Previous yaml dumps made with 0.3.x are INCOMPATIBLE, and so are all scripts.
I can't help you with your API bindings, but for your YAML dumps, a converter script has been provided (see BINARIES).

Please consider all version releases below 1.0.0 to be unstable, even though the code is fully functional - further API changes may not be avoidable between major revisions - such as is the case with 0.3 -> 0.4.

=== Features of nwn-lib

* a feature-complete parser and generator of valid GFF V3.2 data
* shell scripts and tools to simplify your life (see BINARIES)
* kivinen-style ("gffprint.pl") presentation of data
* yaml presentation of data
* ruby-native marshalling of gff data
* extensive developer API
* a powerful get-out-of-my-way scripting system for data transformation (see SCRIPTING)
* guessing of field-types and -values for shorter plaintext data dumps (see TYPE_AND_VALUE_INFERRING)

Also in the box:

* a CHEATSHEET showing off some cool tricks
* some gadgetry for working with 2da files

=== Attention Unicode/UTF-users

ruby 1.8 does not support character sets natively, and as such nwn-gff-irb will <b>FAIL</b> to encode non-standard characters properly on non-latin1 shells.
This will be worked around in a future release until the release of ruby 1.9, which will provide native charset support.

=== Quickstart

To use it, simply install the gem (available on rubyforge):

 gem1.8 install nwn-lib

And do the following in a script of your own devising:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'nwn/all'

For nwn-lib scripts, see SCRIPTING.
