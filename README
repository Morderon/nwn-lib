== A gff library for Neverwinter Nights 1/2 GFF files

This package provides a library for reading, changing, and writing GFF files that are found with NWN[http://nwn.bioware.com/], a Bioware game.

They should work with NWN2 just as well, since the file format specifications did not change.

There are various things included in this distribution:
* some binaries under bin/
* the actual library under lib/nwn

== Quickstart

It is easiest to just use the gem.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'nwn/gff'

  # Read a GFF file
  o = NWN::Gff::Reader.read(IO.read('/tmp/test-creature.gff'))

  # Do some modifications to it
  o['/Tag'] = 'testtag'

  # And write it somewhere else
  bytes = NWN::Gff::Writer.dump(o)

  File.open('/tmp/test-creature-2.gff', 'w') {|f| f.write(bytes) }

Modification API is fairly limited, for now, but will improve soon.
