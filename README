== A library for Neverwinter Nights 1/2 resource files

This package provides a library for reading, changing, and writing common file formats that are found with NWN[http://nwn.bioware.com/], a Bioware game.

They should work with NWN2 just as well, since the file format specifications did not change.

There are various things included in this distribution:
* some binaries under bin/ (see BINARIES)
* the actual library under lib/nwn

== Attention Unicode/UTF-users

ruby 1.8 does not support character sets natively, and as such nwn-gff-irb will <b>FAIL</b> to encode non-standard characters properly on non-latin1 shells.
This will be worked around in a future release until the release of ruby 1.9, which will provide native charset support.
