== A library for Neverwinter Nights 1/2 resource files

This package provides a library for reading, changing, and writing common file formats that are found with NWN[http://nwn.bioware.com/], a Bioware game.

They should work with NWN2 just as well, since the file format specifications did not change.

There are various things included in this distribution:
* some binaries under bin/
* the actual library under lib/nwn

== Supplied binaries
* nwn-gff-print

== Quickstart

It is easiest to just use the gem, which is available through rubyforge (<tt>sudo gem install nwn-lib</tt>).

As an alternative, fetch the latest development files with git[http://git.swordcoast.net/?p=nwn/nwn-lib.git;a=summary].

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'nwn/gff'

  # Read a GFF file
  o = NWN::Gff::Reader.read(IO.read('/tmp/test-creature.gff'))

  # Do some modifications to it
  o['/Tag'] = 'testtag'

  # And write it somewhere else
  bytes = NWN::Gff::Writer.dump(o)

  File.open('/tmp/test-creature-2.gff', 'w') {|f| f.write(bytes) }

Modification API is fairly limited, for now, but will improve soon.

== GFF data structures: Quick Intro

Ruby GFF data structures are nearly a 1:1 wrapper around the known format.

Each GFF object has a root structure with a +struct_id+ of 0.

=== Label
A Label is a string of up to 16 bytes, and occurs as keys in Structs.

=== Struct
A struct is a hash. It is a unordered collection of key => value pairs.
Keys are Labels, values are either:
* Structs
* Lists
* Elements

=== List
A list is an *ordered* array of Structs.

=== Element
A Element is a distinct value of a given type. For all possible types, see the +Types+ hash in the NWN::Gff module.
