==== Convert all item files in the current directory to yaml and back

  for x in *.uti; do
    nwn-gff -i"$x" -o"$x.yml"
  done

  for x in *.uti.yml; do
    nwn-gff -i"$x" -o"$(basename $x .yml)"
  done

==== A Makefile that rebuilds only changed resources

This can be done with a GNU Makefile too, with the added benefit that
it will keep track of changes automagically and only rebuild those resources
that you have changed (saving you a lot of time).

  yml = $(wildcard *.yml)
  gff = $(basename $(yml))

  all: $(gff)

  % : %.yml
      nwn-gff -i $< -o $@
